What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It kind of starts recording a baseline. So there will be a starting point for comparing files after commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is different from the working director and the repository in that it cannot be accessed or it is not physically present? It is not a directory or a folder that one can access. It is an intermediate area.
