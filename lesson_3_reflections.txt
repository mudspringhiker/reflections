When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When collaborating with other people, and/or when you don't have access to local environment but have access to web.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because you don't want all changes available on GitHub (publicly) as soon as you have added the commits. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks are copies of repositories within GitHub. The repositories need not be cloned into local repositories. Forks are then clones, too. But clones is used to copy repositories from GitHub to local environment. Branches are versions of a file that can be created in GitHub and/or locally.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	One can make edits and commit the new versions on this version of the remote. The remote can then be updated later when it is able to be accessed using push or fetch/pull.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	We will be meeting in person to collaborate. Need to set up an appointment for this meeting. Easier in terms of getting the opinion of other party since it's face to face. But without branching tools, it might be hard if the file is complicated.
