When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When collaborating with other people, and/or when you don't have access to local environment but have access to web.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because you don't want all changes available on GitHub (publicly) as soon as you have added the commits.
